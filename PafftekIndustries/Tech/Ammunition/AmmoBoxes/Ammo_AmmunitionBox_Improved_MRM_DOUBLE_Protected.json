		"Details": "Improved Medium Range Missiles are a redesign of the MRM from the ground up. By exchanging the propellent for a newer blend and swapping out the explosive core for a shaped charge the missilesâ€™ aerodynamic structure was able to be refined. This lead to an all around improvement in accuracy through improved aerodynamics and fin stabilization. This is a protected bin, with flame and explosive reducing baffles, that reduces damage in the advent of an Ammo Explosion.   However it is still recommended to equip C.A.S.E! Has 380 shots.",
