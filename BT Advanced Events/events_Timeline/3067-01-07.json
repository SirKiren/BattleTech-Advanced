The Third Crucis Lancers, Blackwind Lancers and 244th Com Guards followed the Loyalist Third Republican and Fifteenth Deneb Light Cavalry's to Marlette.  Though heavily outnumbered, the remaining Loyalists are determined to follow Archon-Princess Katrina Steiner-Davion's directive to tie up as many troops as possible from fighting on New Avalon.\n\nIn a similar situation, Allied forces on Cavanaugh are closing in on the last Loyalist stronghold in the city of Caerleon.  General Richard Steiner, commander of the Loyalist forces on the planet, have exhorted his troops to \"fight to the last soldier\", hoping to buy time for both reinforcements, and to tie up Allied troops as long as possible from the conflict on Tharkhad.",
