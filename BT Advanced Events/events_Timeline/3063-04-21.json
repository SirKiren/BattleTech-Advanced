Even before Victor’s call to arms against Katrina, brutal fighting was commonplace on the streets of notable planets such as [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSolaris7], Solaris VII]] and [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKathil], Kathil]]. Now, with the campaign to unseat [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKatherineSteiner],Katrina]] in full swing, once-allied units have turned against each other as the conflict of brother versus sister is played out on countless battlefields across the Inner Sphere.  In related news, the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMRBC], Mercenary Review and Bonding Commission]] has begun trials of its new mercenary sponsorship program. Under this new initiative, previously independent mercenary commanders apply for sponsorship from a larger, more prestigious mercenary regiment. This relationship can give both a sense of political alignment and can lead to the inclusion of these smaller companies into their sponsor regiments. Current sponsors are the Kell Hounds, Wolf’s Dragoons, the Northwind Highlanders, and the recently reconstituted Gray Death Legion. Interested parties should contact the MRBC on Outreach.\r\n\n\nWould you like to know more?",

As the militia has split along factional lines, the mounting fighting has taken a terrible toll on local resources. Militia forces are imposing martial law and seizing supplies from local industrial complexes. The Halloran Mining & Excavation cartel has had enough of this semi-official banditry.  The Transpax Corporation of Halloran V, a member of the Halloran Mining & Excavation cartel, has instituted corporate security measures in the face of what corporate spokesmen claim to be wanton piracy and banditry by local militia commanders. Details are unclear, but it has been confirmed that Transpax is seeking to contract mercenary units for short-term defense along some of Transpax's coastal holdings.",
