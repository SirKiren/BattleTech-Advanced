While the attacks have been widely compared to Chancellor Sun-Tzu Liao's previous successful forays into the Chaos March, the Capellan Confederation has officially denied involvement.\n\nFor the beleaguered Chaos March governments however, help is on the way.  The Capellan March's Duke George Hasek II has also sent mercenary commands to the region.  Cunningham's Commandos have already landed at Acamar, while the Twelfth Vegan Rangers Beta Regiment is already en-route to Arboris and Genoa to blunt the pro-Capellan attacks.  In a recent speech, Duke George had this to say:\n\n\"For too long now, we have stood by and watched as Sun-Tzu attacked, conquered and subjugated world after world in the Sarna March.... Officially, we stand by the wayside because we respect the right of self-determination. But is it self-determination when Capellan 'Mech regiments invade? Do we really do them a favor by letting these worlds stand free, but without the protection they need from the Capellan Confederation? Of course not!... I extend an invitation to any and all worlds seeking protection from Capellan invaders. You have an alternative. We will stand together against Liao aggression!\"\n\nIn response, all three worlds have officially requested protection from Duke George and the AFFS.",

While containing the Loyalist Donegal Jaegers, the Allied Twenty-fifth Arcturan Guard overran Garvinny Prison and liberated many political detainees, among them was Duke Robert Kelswa-Steiner.  Released by Prince Peter Steiner-Davion are part of a political agreement, Duke Robert withdrew to Skye where he had a touching reunion with his young wife before assuming direct control over Free Skye operations in the province.  With the main Free Skye effort at Hesperus deadlocked, and with the winner of the battles on Tharkad widely expected to deal with the Free Skye movement once and for all, Duke Robert's options appear limited at best.",
