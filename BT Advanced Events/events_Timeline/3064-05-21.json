While Count McNally is no friend of Major Cater, it remains to be seen if the Count will take advantage of this situation for his own benefit.",

While not openly making raids against other [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreGreatHouses],Great House]] or even pro-[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreVictorSD],Victor]] [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreAllied],Allied]] commands, the Thirteenth is holding their own against various Chaos March raiders and pirates.  Still, their refusal to move has led the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSteinerLAAF],LAAF]] to mark them as \"rogue\".\r\n\n\nMeanwhile on New Home, the Thirtieth Lyran Guard have returned to the planet despite Archon-Princess Katrina Steiner's recall orders.  The Lyrans found in their brief absence, the pro-[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreXinSheng],Liao]] New Home Regulars have taken control of the planet, and the Thirtieth are now in the process of sweeping the Regulars out.  Rumours abound that the Thirtieth are seeking to claim New Home as their own independent fief, and the Lyrans are seeking further mercenary support.  Meanwhile the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreLiaoCCAF],CCAF]] continues to send reinforcements for the Regulars.\r\n\n\nContracts are available via the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMRBC],MRBC]] database.",
