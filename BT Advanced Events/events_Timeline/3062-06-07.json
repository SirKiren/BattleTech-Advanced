Total casualties of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreThuggee],Thuggee]] attacks are reported to be in the vicinity of 10000, a far cry from the nearly 5 million casualties initially estimated. Although Capellan authorities publicly cooperated with their [[DM.Factions[faction_Ives],St. Ives Compact]] counterparts in apprehending the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreThuggee],Thuggee]] terrorists and halting the attacks, some within the Compact have accused the Capellans of dragging their feet and tacitly allowing the Black May attacks to proceed. The fact that [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreThuggee],Thuggee]] terrorists apprehended by the Capellans simply disappear into [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMaskirovka],Maskirovka]] custody rather than being publicly tried further fuels these accusations.\r\n\n\nPlease stay tuned for more news from the Chaos March.",

General Helen Thrall of the invading Lancers has stated it is her intention is to conquer these worlds for the Free Worlds League, and reform - along with Graham IV and Pollux - the original Sirian Concordance.  News from both planets have been sketchy over the years since the seizure of both planet's HPG stations by ex-Comstar Adept [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreAlisGyrn],Alisander Gyrn]] and his declaration of the Sirian Holds.  Early reports from the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreFWLM],FWLM]] task force, however, indicate the discovery of mass killing fields and of other atrocities, apparently at the hands of the Gyrn regime.\r\n\n\n[[DM.Factions[faction_Liao],CAPELLAN CONFEDERATION]] BESEIGES SARNA SUPREMACY\r\n\n\n[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreHouseLiao],House Liao]] has opened a new battlefield in it's [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreXinSheng],Xin Sheng]] campaigns.  Using secondary attacks and naval assets to pin down the Supremacy's defenders on Sakhalin and on Sarna itself, [[DM.Factions[faction_WarriorHouseImarra],Warrior House Imarra]] has invaded the Supremacy's breadbasket world of Kaifeng.  Observers believe that if the Capellans can seize Kaifeng, they will be able to starve the Sarna Supremacy into submission without a lengthy and costly conflict.",
