		"Details": "PRINCE PETER CLAIMS ARCHONSHIP, FREE SKYE REBELLION OVER!\r\n\n\nTharkad, Lyran Alliance:  After a devastating setback at the Battle of the Wash, Lyran Regent Nondi Steiner's Loyalist defenders fell back on the capital city and the Triad governmental complex for a final stand.  In the midst of brutal street fighting, Duchess Nondi died on April 2nd at the hands of her nephew, Prince Peter Steiner-Davion.  With the final surrender of the Second Royal Guards on April 5th, Prince Peter has declared combat in the Lyran Alliance to be over.  More importantly, Prince Peter has declared himself Archon pro-tem until the future of both realms is decided on New Avalon.\n\nIn related news, Free Skye leader Duke Robert Kelswa-Steiner has announced his support Prince Peter's claim for Archonship.  Reports indicate the Duke was able to secure \"greater autonomy\" for the Isle of Skye from Prince Peter, and as such called on all Free Skye units to stand down.  The majority of Loyalist, Allied and Free Skye units have acted in accordance with Prince Peter's and Duke Robert's calls for peace, and fighting has largely died out across the Lyran Alliance.",
