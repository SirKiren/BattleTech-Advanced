They piloted BattleMechs of obvious recent construction, as well as Star League-era and even a few Clan OmniMechs.  The unknown aggressors are attacking several periphery Lyran world in the Milissia Theater, including a deep strike at the world of Khartoum. \n\nThe only clues to the bandit's identities were the olive drab paint schemes on their 'Mechs, and their focus on archaeological sites of religious or cultural significance, and old Star League locations.  The Quanatir MTM and Interstellar Expeditions are calling for mercenary reinforcements against what are already called the \"Green Ghosts\", and the Periphery Star Guard, Devil's Brigade and Gabhardt's Carabineers are already en-route.",

Only the arrival of the Loyalist Fifth Deneb Light Cavalry and First Republican prevented a total rout of the pro-Katrina forces.  With both sides entrenched on what is considered the warm-up for a pending showdown on New Avalon, the campaign for Marlette grinds on.",
