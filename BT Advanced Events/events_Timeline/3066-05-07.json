The combined Eighth Syrtis Fusiliers, Davion Light Guard, and Vanguard Legion won a bitter struggle against the Fourth Donegal Guards and the Eleventh Avalon Hussars at a very heavy price. The capital city, Saso, lies in complete ruin, along with the much beloved Morgan Hasek-Davion Glacier Memorial. The Duke made clear his intention to stay out of the continued civil war between Archon Princess Katrina Steiner's and Prince Victor Davion's supporters.\r\n\nMany accounts note that the mercenary Vanguard Legion proved pivotal in putting down the invaders. As more and more regular military units find themselves split over the political issues behind this civil war, it may well be mercenaries who decide the fate of the beleaguered Federated Commonwealth.",
