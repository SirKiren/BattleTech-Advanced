On August 20th, after an initial parlay, forces from the Kell Hounds, Blue Star Irregulars, Twentieth Arcturan Guard and Clan-Wolf-in-Exile's Fourth Wolf Guards arrived in-system to assault the planet.  Meanwhile, the First and Second Royal Guard regiments, backed by the Alarion Guard and Comstar's Sixty-Sixth Division have hunkered down in positions around Tharkad City as Peter's invasion force move closer.\n\nReinforcements are being called in by both sides from around the Lyran Alliance.  Loyalists are reportedly en-route to add to Nondi Steiner's strength, followed closely by the Fourth Skye Rangers to support Peter.  Even now, battle formations are closing together in what most observers believe will determine the future of the Lyran Alliance.",
