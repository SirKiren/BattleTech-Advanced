The Arcturan Guards were caught by complete surprise when the planetary militia, led by mercenary command Smithson's Chinese Bandits, attacked the Seventeenth while they were landing.  The Arcturans were quickly reinforced by the Loyalist Archenar SMM, and Smithson's Chinese Bandits are reported to be on the run.  Pro-Victor General Koenig has made an open call for mercenaries to joing the Fifth Syrtis Fusiliers as they reinforce the Chinese Bandits.  Noted mercenaries Wilson's Hussars, lured by favourable salvage rights and preferential treatment for future AFFS contracts, have already signed with Koenig and are en-route to the planet.",
