On Freedom, the arrival of Maria Esteban has signalled a new surge of attacks against the 5th Lyran Guard, now considered by all to be desperately holding on.  On Eaton, governor Jonathan Thayer has declared for the separatist movement.  Meanwhile, the Loyalist Eleventh Arcturan Guard and the Alarion Jaegers landed on Skye itself, defended by the Skye Jaegers and the planetary militia.  Most importantly however, on Hesperus the 4th Skye landed to reinforce the Separatist 17th Skye Rangers and 14th and 32nd Lyran Guards already onplanet against the defenders, which include a now decimated Gray Death Legion.  This signals a new round of fighting in the region, and all sides are calls for mercenaries to fill their ranks.",
