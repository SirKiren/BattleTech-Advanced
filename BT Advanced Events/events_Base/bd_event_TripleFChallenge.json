		"Details": "Darius walks into the morning briefing with the biggest smile you've ever seen on his face. He slaps down a brown paper bag with the unmistakeable logo of Triple F Burgers emblazoned on the front. \"Commander, I just got the best offer ever with my meal deal this morning down on the planet. Triple F wants us to fight on their behalf!!\" Yang guffaws, \"We gotta do it, Boss!.\" You look skeptically at the paper bag. \"You want to explain that, Darius?\" The XO laughs and explains that Triple F has a rivalry with another fast food chain, T-Bone's Terrific Tubesteaks, and their marketing teams have escalated the rivalry to the point of actual arena combat. Apparently, Triple F wants experienced MechWarriors and that's you.",
